# DungeonSoul

This is a 3D action game where the player controls a Paladin fighting against a Werewolf boss.  
The Werewolf uses three different attacks to challenge the player. When its health drops below 30%, it becomes enraged and unlocks a powerful jump attack.  
The Paladin can perform normal attacks and a dash move to evade or close distance, making timing and positioning critical for survival.
